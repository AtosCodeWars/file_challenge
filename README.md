# File Challenge

Somehow we lost the super secret finish line passphrase somewhere in these files. We think it's in a file called "finish_line.txt".
Clone this repo and please find it for us. The contents of the files should help guide you to the answer. Hint: Follow the Olympic Rings

If working on a windows computer, use git bash (type "git bash" in start window)
